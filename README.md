# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) on Sprites Dataset

This project implements a **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)** using **PyTorch** to learn the distribution of sprite images and generate new ones from noise.  
The model‚Äôs performance is evaluated using the **Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)** score to assess the realism of generated images.

## üìò Overview
DDPMs are a class of **generative models** that learn data distributions by gradually denoising Gaussian noise through a diffusion process.  
This notebook trains a **U-Net‚Äìbased DDPM** on the **Sprites dataset**, demonstrating image synthesis capabilities in a compact, interpretable setup.
